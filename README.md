This project upgrades a Gaggia espresso machine with smart controls to improve your coffee-making experience. By adding a display and custom electronics, you can monitor and control the machine more easily.

### How to buy

You can buy your kit on https://shop.gaggimate.eu/

## How It Works

The display allows you to control the espresso machine and see live temperature updates. If the machine becomes unresponsive or the temperature goes too high, it will automatically turn off for safety.
